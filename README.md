# Acumen Hardware Monitor

A WIP TUI-based hardware monitor, with HwInfo64 on Windows as inspiration.

Hardware monitoring on Linux sucks. I want to change that.

Overall Goals:

* Easily extendable to get information from custom module drivers
* Customize module and sensor names, values, etc.
* Log, view, and chart sensor values over time
* Other stuff that I'm probably forgetting
